### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Micheal Erickson, a Junior at Brigham Young University.

<!-- **MikeSE314/MikeSE314** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

<!-- Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m collaborating on a PCS (**P**layable **C**ase **S**tudy); a gamified way to learn real-world IT topics. This one's about a cybersecurity threat to a town, where players learn to recognize and respond to threats to city infrastructure.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a TA for BYU's IT&C 210: Fundamentals of Web-based IT
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Cybersecurity and Information Technology at Brigham Young University
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email me at micheal.erickson3.14@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: my name is spelled Micheal ('ea' *not* 'ae') because my father misspelled it on my birth certificate. I grew up learning to spell it 'ae', but when I was 15 years old, my father and I went to the DMV with my Social Security card to get my Driver's Permit. We were standing in line, and my father looked at the paper, then to me, and said, "I have something to tell you . . ."
